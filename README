I extracted this from a set of visualization tools named the Shed (http://devel.se.wtb.tue.nl/trac/shed/browser/trunk/visualization/ganttchart).

It takes a file of time intervals described in the syntax:
Resource start stop label
...
and produces the corresponding gnuplot code.

You can associate a color to each time interval.
I simplified a little bit the interface and added an option in order to set the maximum time of the plot.
